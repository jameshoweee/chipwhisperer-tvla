ChipWhisperer-TVLA
==============================================

Welcome to the home of the documentation for ChipWhisperer-TVLA!

Test Vector Leakage Assessment (TVLA) is a testing methodology
for evaluating embedded devices' resistance to side channel power analysis
attacks. This library is a part of the NewAE mission to make
researching and understanding side channel attacks on embedded devices
more accessable.

For more information on TVLA, check out the `original paper describing TVLA <https://csrc.nist.gov/csrc/media/events/non-invasive-attack-testing-workshop/documents/08_goodwill.pdf>`_, as well
as RamBus's `TVLA Derived Test Requirements <https://www.rambus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/TVLA-DTR-with-AES.pdf>`_, of which this library
is based on.
